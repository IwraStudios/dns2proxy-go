# Dns2Proxy-go
An golang port of dns2proxy (https://github.com/LeonardoNve/dns2proxy) made for the cSploit community

This is not an ready to use project/code, this is this in development

## Roadmap(for the nearby future):
* nothing unexpected just making the code
* added some documentation and refrence points to the original code
* making it a "job" module for use in cSploit2
* adding a new and better roadmap
